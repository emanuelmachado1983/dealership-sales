# 🚗 Dealership Microservices System

A **microservices-based backend system** designed as a practical exercise to demonstrate **clean architecture, service decomposition, and inter-service communication**, using a real-world dealership domain.

The project is built with **Java & Spring Boot**, uses **REST APIs**, includes **initial gRPC examples**, and is **fully prepared for Kubernetes (K8s) deployment**.

## 🧩 Overview

This repository contains a **distributed backend system** composed of multiple independent microservices.

The main goals of this project are:

- Apply **microservices architecture** principles
- Model realistic **business rules**
- Demonstrate **service-to-service communication**
- Show readiness for **Kubernetes-based deployments**
- Provide a clean and extensible base for future improvements

> ⚠️ **Note**: Unit and integration tests are pending and will be added in future iterations.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

- Microservices-based architecture
- Independent deployments per service
- No centralized service registry (no Eureka / Spring Cloud)
- Service discovery handled by **Kubernetes**
- REST for synchronous communication
- Initial **gRPC** support (to be expanded)

Each microservice owns its **domain logic and data**, following clear responsibility boundaries.

## 🔧 Microservices

### Places (Integrated into Offices)

Originally designed as a standalone microservice, **Places** was later integrated into the **Offices** service to simplify deployment and integration.

This module is intentionally reusable across other projects.

#### Entities
- **Countries**
- **Provinces**
- **Localities**

📌 **Design decision**:  
Buenos Aires (Capital Federal) is treated as a *province* instead of a locality to reduce domain complexity during development.

---

### Offices

Manages dealership offices and delivery configurations.

#### Entities
- **Office** – Dealership branches
- **TypeOffice** – Office type (Central or Dealership)
- **DeliverySchedules** – Delivery times:
  - Central → Dealership
  - Local delivery within the same dealership

#### Key Rules
- The **Central office always has `id = 1`**
- Creating or modifying another Central office is not allowed
- Delivery times are globally configured (MVP simplification)

#### gRPC
This service includes a **working gRPC example**, serving as a foundation for future gRPC-based communication between services.

---

### Vehicles

Manages all vehicle-related data.

#### Entities
- **ModelVehicles** – Vehicle models (year and price)
- **TypeVehicles** – Vehicle types and warranty years
- **VehicleStates**
  - Available
  - Reserved
  - Sold
  - Delivered
  - Under Repair
- **Vehicles** – Individual vehicles, including:
  - Current office location
  - Current state

#### Features
Vehicles can be queried by:
- Office location
- State
- Model
- Type

This allows sellers to identify which vehicles are available for sale in their office.

---

### Maintain (Repairs)

Handles vehicle repairs.

> Ideally this should be a fully independent microservice, but it was integrated for time constraints.

#### Entities
- **MechanicalRepairs**

#### Business Rules
- Only **Delivered** vehicles can be repaired
- When a repair starts:
  - Vehicle state → **Under Repair**
- When a repair ends:
  - Vehicle state → **Delivered**

#### Warranty Validation
- Warranty years are copied into the **Sale** at purchase time
- This preserves historical consistency if warranty rules change
- Warranty validation requires querying the **Sales** service

---

### Sales

Manages dealership sales and contains the **most complex business logic**.

#### Entities
- **Customers**
- **Employees**
- **SaleStates**
  - Pending
  - Completed
  - Canceled
- **Sales**

#### Core Logic
When creating a sale:
- Validates vehicle and office existence
- Calculates delivery date:
  - Local delivery if vehicle belongs to the seller’s office
  - Central → Dealership + local delivery otherwise
- Retrieves warranty data from **Vehicles**
- Updates vehicle state to **Reserved**

When finalizing a sale:
- Vehicle state → **Sold**

This service interacts heavily with **Offices** and **Vehicles**.

---

### Customers

Manages customer information.

#### Entities
- **Customers**

Provides standard CRUD operations.

---

## 🔗 Inter-Service Communication

- **REST APIs** for most service interactions
- **gRPC**:
  - Implemented as a working example between **Offices** and **Vehicles**.
  - Additional gRPC integrations will be added in other services

---

## ☸ Kubernetes Deployment

The repository includes a dedicated **`k8s/` directory** containing:

- `Deployment` manifests per microservice
- `Service` definitions for internal communication
- Environment configuration via YAML

This allows the full system to be **deployed into a Kubernetes cluster** without external infrastructure dependencies.

✔ No Eureka  
✔ No Spring Cloud Server  
✔ Kubernetes-native service discovery

---

## 🧪 Testing Status

🚧 **Pending**:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests

These will be added in future iterations to improve robustness and coverage.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add unit and integration tests
- Expand gRPC usage across microservices
- Improve resilience (timeouts, retries)
